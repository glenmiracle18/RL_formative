# Genetic Mutation Environment Reinforcement Learning Project Report

## 1. Project Overview

This project implements reinforcement learning to optimize agent behavior in a simulated genetic mutation testing environment. The agent must efficiently explore a spatial grid representing mutations with varying quality scores while managing a limited budget for testing. We address the challenge of balancing exploration and exploitation in this constrained environment.

Our approach uses Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Policy Gradient (PPO and A2C) algorithms implemented with Stable Baselines3 to train agents on maximizing cumulative rewards based on mutation test outcomes. The project includes environment visualization, detailed reward modeling, and logging training progress and performance.

## 2. Environment Description

### 2.1 Agent(s)

The environment has a single agent representing a testing entity capable of moving on a 5x5 grid of mutation sites. The agent starts centrally at position (2,2) and can test mutations or move within bounds. It has a limited budget initially set to 100, which decreases with testing actions. 

The agent's capabilities include:
- Discrete movement (up, down, left, right)
- Mutation testing action
- Budget management

Limitations include grid boundaries and budget depletion, which terminates episodes.

### 2.2 Action Space

The action space is discrete with 5 actions:
- **0: Test Mutation** (uses budget, yields reward based on mutation quality)
- **1: Move Up** (agent moves 2 units up if valid)
- **2: Move Down** (agent moves 2 units down if valid)
- **3: Move Left** (agent moves 2 units left if valid)
- **4: Move Right** (agent moves 2 units right if valid)

### 2.3 State Space

The observation space is a continuous 3-dimensional vector:
- Current mutation's EVO2 score at the agent's position (float 0 to 1)
- Normalized remaining budget (float 0 to 1)
- Mutation type placeholder (currently 0, can be extended for mutation categories)

This compact state representation provides partial observable information sufficient for decision-making.

### 2.4 Reward Structure

Rewards depend on the testing action and the quality of the mutation:
- **Testing a high-value mutation** (EVO2 score > 0.8): +10
- **Testing a medium-value mutation** (EVO2 score > 0.5): +5
- **Testing a low-value mutation** (â‰¤ 0.5): -2
- **Movement actions**: No explicit reward (implied zero)
- **Budget depletion**: Results in termination with a penalty of -10

The reward function encourages the agent to prioritize testing high-quality mutations and conserve the limited budget.

**Mathematical Representation:**
```
For action = test (0):
  If EVO2_score > 0.8: Reward = +10
  Else if EVO2_score > 0.5: Reward = +5
  Else: Reward = -2

Budget depletion: Reward = -10 and episode terminates
```

### 2.5 Environment Visualization

The environment is visualized as a 5x5 grid rendered with Pygame. Each cell is colored in shades of red proportional to its mutation EVO2 score, with the agent shown as a blue square on top of the grid cell corresponding to its current position. The visualization updates every step during render mode 'human', facilitating intuitive understanding of agent position and mutation landscape.

**Enhanced Visualization Features:**
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Pulsing agent effects
- Color-coded mutation cells
- Professional UI panel with real-time statistics
- Step-by-step action logging

## 3. Implemented Methods

### 3.3 Hyperparameter Analysis

The following tables summarize the optimal hyperparameters found for each algorithm and their impact on performance:

#### 3.3.1 DQN Hyperparameters

| Hyperparameter | Optimal Value | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Learning Rate | 0.0003 | A conservative learning rate that ensures stable learning by allowing gradual weight updates, preventing oscillations and promoting convergence stability. |
| Gamma (Discount Factor) | 0.99 | High discount factor prioritizes future rewards, encouraging long-term strategic thinking essential for budget management in the mutation testing environment. |
| Replay Buffer Size | 10000 | Large buffer size improves sample efficiency by storing diverse experiences, enabling better gradient estimates and reducing correlation between consecutive updates. |
| Batch Size | 32 | Balanced batch size providing good trade-off between gradient noise reduction and computational efficiency, standard for DQN implementations. |
| Exploration Strategy | 0.1 (final epsilon) | Epsilon-greedy strategy with 0.1 final exploration rate maintains sufficient exploration to discover high-value mutations while exploiting learned knowledge. |

#### 3.3.2 A2C Hyperparameters

| Hyperparameter | Optimal Value | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Learning Rate | 0.0007 | Slightly higher learning rate than DQN compensates for actor-critic variance, enabling faster convergence while maintaining training stability in policy gradient methods. |
| Gamma (Discount Factor) | 0.99 | Consistent with DQN, high discount factor encourages long-term planning crucial for effective budget utilization and strategic mutation testing. |
| N steps | 5 | Multi-step returns reduce bias in value estimates while maintaining manageable variance, providing good balance for the episodic nature of mutation testing. |
| Policy | MlpPolicy | Neural network policy approximation provides sufficient capacity to learn complex state-action mappings in the constrained mutation environment. |
| Total Episodes | 93 | Sufficient training episodes to demonstrate convergence behavior, though plateau effects suggest diminishing returns beyond episode 40. |
| Average Episode Length | 107.01 | Indicates effective budget management - episodes neither too short (under-exploration) nor maximum length (inefficient testing strategies). |

#### 3.3.3 PPO Hyperparameters

| Hyperparameter | Optimal Value | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Learning Rate | 0.0003 | Conservative learning rate works well with PPO's clipped objective function, preventing destructive policy updates and ensuring stable improvement trajectory. |
| Total Timesteps | 100000 | Extensive training enables PPO to fully exploit its sample efficiency advantages, leading to superior final performance compared to other methods. |
| Batch Size | 64 | Larger batch size than DQN reduces gradient variance in policy updates, contributing to PPO's superior stability and fastest convergence among tested algorithms. |
| Policy | MlpPolicy | Neural network policy provides adequate representational power for the discrete action space and continuous state observations in mutation testing. |
| Total Episodes | 31 | Remarkably few episodes needed for convergence demonstrates PPO's sample efficiency - achieving best performance with least training episodes required. |

**Key Insights:**
